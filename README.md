# DeepSite Locally ðŸš€

![Banner Screenshot](./localconfig.png)

Run **DeepSite** on your own environment, without depending on Hugging Face!
Perfect for those who want to customize, integrate, or simply have full control over the platform.

---

## How to Run DeepSite Locally

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MartinsMessias/deepsite-locally.git
```

### 2. Configure environment variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and change `APP_PORT` if you want the server to run
on another port. If not configured, the server defaults to **3000**.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Install dependencies
(Make sure you have **Node.js** installed)
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Development commands
* `npm run dev`  - start the Vite dev server.
* `npm run lint` - run ESLint on the codebase.
* `npm run build` - compile TypeScript and build production assets.
* `npm run start` - run the compiled Express server.

### 5. Build the project
```bash
npm run build
```

### 6. Start the server
```bash
npm run start
```

## Docker
You can also run DeepSite using Docker:
```bash
docker build -t deepsite .
docker run -p 3000:3000 deepsite
```

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

The repository includes a workflow to automatically build and publish the site
using **GitHub Pages**. Push changes to the `main` branch and GitHub Actions
will deploy the latest production build to the `gh-pages` environment.

You can also build the static files locally:

```bash
npm run build
```

The generated files in the `dist` folder are what GitHub Pages serves.

## Login and Remix features
`/api/login` and `/api/remix` routes are used when running DeepSite inside the
Hugging Face Hub. They are not implemented in this repository, so those
features will only work when deployed as a Hugging Face Space or if you provide
your own backend endpoints.

## Inference providers
Click the gear icon in the UI to configure which provider is used for AI
requests. You can choose `local` (for services like Ollama) or `openrouter` and
provide the corresponding API key, base URL and model. The settings are stored
locally in your browser.
